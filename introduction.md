This site allows you to try different variables with Chicago's Food Inspection Model.  Code is available on [Github](https://github.com/rajshah4/food-inspections-evaluation).

You can find the original model by the city of Chicago here on [Github](https://github.com/Chicago/food-inspections-evaluation). 

This shiny app is just a quick working demo for me to better understand the model.  I am currently working on evaluating and improving the food prediction model.
It should just drop into any fork of the model by using the three shiny files, ui.r,server.r, and global.r.
